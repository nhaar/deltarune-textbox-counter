Welcome the UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE (Chapters 1 & 2 DEMO) Textbox Counter Mod!

# Currently in Beta!

The mod is nearing completion and can already be used, but it still needs to be tested and improved before the full release. Ask me (`nhaar` on discord) for updates.

[DOWNLOAD BETA HERE](https://github.com/nhaar/deltarune-textbox-counter/releases/tag/v0.0.0-beta)

# Installation guide

* DELTARUNE requirements: You must have either Steam version 1.10 (which is what you will have if you download it without changing the version) or version 1.15.
* UNDERTALE requirements: You must have Steam version 1.08 (the default version available)

To install the mod, download the appropriate patch for your version. Apply the patch to the `data.win` in your game's folder. To apply the patch you can use resources such as [this website](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/). Replace the
old `data.win` with the patched one and the mod will be ready to play.

# Beta Testing

The mod is currently in beta testing for both UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE. Here's how you can help:

* Download the mod that you want to test!
* [Take a look at all the unverified textbox here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1utUCy32Md_HLG4sLHdpNM1uUREUgM90pLe46-EdG9wY/edit?usp=sharing)
* If you see a textbox in there that is possible, try to get it! Then, send me your textcount file, which will be in the savefile directory
* If you see an IMPOSSIBLE or UNUSED textbox, you can either send them to me OR create a pull request editting the respective unused list
* You can take a look at the rest of the `LangList` files, and see if you know anything that is still not there
* Report any bugs that make the game unplayable!
* Report any occasions of the text not having proper width, like this:

* Report any occasions of the text displaying a weird name
